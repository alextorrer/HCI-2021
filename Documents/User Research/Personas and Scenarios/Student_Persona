###**Persona**: *Student*  
###**Name**: *Juan Pech*  
###**Age**: *19*  
###**Location**: *Mérida, Yucatán*  
###**Occupation**: *College student*  
###**Backstory.**  
He rents a place in Mérida so he doesn’t have to travel everyday a lot of hours to go to the campus.  
His family doesn’t have a lot of money, but they make an effort playing the place he stays at and sending him money for transport and food.  
He’s very committed to school, even if he doesn’t get the best grades, he puts in the time to learn and do his homework.  
Even if he doesn’t save money, he doesn’t eat properly most of the time, because of lack of options to eat nearby, the prices, and the time he has available.  
Most of his meals consist on fast food from the cafeteria and packaged food.  

###**Motivations and frustrations**  
He’d love to have extra money to pay for some proper meals, and would also love if the prices of the food places nearby went down.  
 
###**Scenario**  
Juan wants to apply for the food scholarship the Faculty of mathematics is offering, so food is never a problem for him and he can completely focus on his studies while always eating healthy lunches.  
He will need a place where he can apply to the scholarship, and he has to answer certain surveys for it (personal data, socioeconomic status and alimentary habits) so he can request the scholarship. This place is a module located in the salesforce community, and with a simple click he will be able to access and fill the surveys.  
Once he does this, after a revision period of time, he will be notified via email if he was accepted for the scholarship or no.
