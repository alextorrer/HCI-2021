# Team Management

## Process
- Each team member will be an owner of a project artifact. His job it's to make sure that the artifact is well defined, structured and aligned to the project goals.
- The team leader will be responsible of splitting and assigning the remaining work in tasks and activities. 

## Roles and Responsabilities
- **Alejandro Torre** - Team Leader
- **Gildardo Maldonado** - Designer
- **Jorge Anzures** - Designer
- **Miguel √Åvila** - Designer

## Monitoring
- Each task or activity should include the due date, priority, *T-shirt size* (estimation) and assignee.
- The activities are going to be managed in a kanban board on a **Notion** Workspace.

## Individual Contribution
- We are going to use *T-Shirt size* for each activity as a measure in terms of complexity and effort.
- The size of each activity will be estimated by the whole team.
- This metric will be mapped as {S = 1; M = 2; L = 3; XL = 4}
- We decided to use this metric because it's simpler to make the estimation.
