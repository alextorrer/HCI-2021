# Team Management

## Process
Each team member will be an owner of a project artifact. His job it's to make sure that the artifact is well defined, structured and aligned to the project goals.  
The development of the several artifacts is responsability of the whole team.  
The team leader will be responsible of splitting and assigning the remaining work in tasks and activities. 

## Roles
- **Alejandro Torre** - Team Leader
- **Gildardo Maldonado** - Designer
- **Jorge Anzures** - Designer
- **Miguel Ávila** - Designer

## Artifacts & Owners

## Monitoring
Each task or activity should include the due date, priority, *T-shirt size* (estimation) and assignee.  
The activities are going to be managed in a kanban board on a **Notion** Workspace.

## Individual Contribution
We are going to use *T-Shirt size* for each activity as a measure in terms of complexity and effort.  
The size of each activity will be estimated by the whole team.  
This metric will be mapped as {XS = 1; S = 2; M = 3; L = 5; XL = 8}.  
We decided to use this metric because it's simpler to make the estimation.
