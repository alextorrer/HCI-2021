# Project Plan

## User Centered Design
According to the Interaction Design Foundation, the User-centered design (UCD) is an iterative design process in which designers focus on the users and their needs in each phase of the design process. In UCD, design teams involve users throughout the design process via a variety of research and design techniques, to create highly usable and accessible products for them.

## Background
We are basing our project plan and structure from the [Product Design Process](https://www.imaginarycloud.com/blog/product-design-process/) developed by Imaginary Cloud. But due the requirements of our project we decided to adapat the proposal towards our needs.  
We are also taking from trusted sources several strategies and methods which we consider will be useful for our project. 
One principle of the UCD is the iterative feedback collection from the user, hence it is important to mention that we are planning recurrent testing within the phases and activities in the project.

## Plan Overview
As this project is already developed, the approach we are taking it's the validation of the current user experience, perform analysis to collect user feedback and provide enhancements based on the data collected.  

1. Research
    - Personas
        > We will define our personas and scenarios based on the goals of the development team.
    - Task Analysis
        > We are planning to consider people (not necessarily users due to logistics constraints) matching our personas as the subjects for this activity.
    - System Usability Scale
        > Have the bigger picture before we start with the following phases.
    1.4. Non Funcional Requirements
2. Ideation
    - User Journey
    - Wireframes
    - Parallel Design
3. Execution
    - Prototypes
    - System Usability Scale

## Team Management
- We have decided not to create a Calendar for our activities because we have no experience in this type of projects. Therefore, we find very difficult to provide an accurate estimate for the different stages and activities.
- Overall, the team roles consist on one Team Leader (Alejandro Torre) and three desginers/developers.
