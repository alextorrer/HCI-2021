# Human Computer Interaction 2021

## Project
Sometimes college students are so committed to the faculty that they don't have enough time or money to have a healthy lunch. This can affect the health and concentration of these students, so they may have a drop in their level of study, or on several occasions they have to go to places outside of the faculty, causing them to be late for their class hours. That is why the Faculty of Mathematics seeks to support students through food scholarships, so that this is not a burden for students and they can finished university.  

This is an already functional project which was developed by another team at the university. We want to help this social program to succeed by focusing our contribution in the Human computer interaction, usability and user experience components of the project.
